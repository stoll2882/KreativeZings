# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Kreative Zings Web App Setup
Navigate to root directory of react-app and complete the "npm install" command in order to install all neccessary dependencies.\
Make sure MongoDB is installed on your personal computer. If it is not, you will need brew or another platform in order to install.\
Here is a link to the MongoDB installation website that will walk you through specific instructions: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/ make sure you check it is installed before attempting run of databse.\
Instantiate a "passwords.js" file in the backend folder. This will be used to authenticate login to send emails. A .gitignore file is used to avoid security issues and it is not included on this repository.

### To run...
Navigate into a terminal window on your computer - or a terminal within visual studio code (or your preferred platform), and navigate into "react-app".\
Open a second terminal window on your computer or on your preferred platform, and navigate into the "backend" folder within the react-app.\
First, do an npm build run in the react-app terminal in order to create your react build folder.\
Then, do an npm start in that same folder to see the website come to life!\
Lastly, run an npm start in the backend terminal so that the local database is running as the app is being used.\
Navigate around the web app however you would like! :)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
